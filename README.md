# Hack4Rice - Team Xtra Rice

This serves as the official repository of Team Xtra Rice for the Hack4Rice hackathon 2019. 
Team Xtra Rice has chosen Phenotype Prediction Challenge. 


# Phenotype Prediction Challenge
Build a machine learning model to predict the value of a certain numeric phenotypes given a high-dimensional genotype information,
You will be given a training dataset consisting of numerically encoded genotype data for genetically distinct rice varieties, along with records of certain agronomically important traits for the same varieties (such as grain yield, plant height, days to flowering). Your goal is to implement a model that would predict the values of these phenotypes given genotype data of an unseen rice sample. (It can be a single model for all traits or one model for each trait. You may use any programming language or ML framework. We will also provide a baseline model against which you can test your model. Once your model(s) is ready for submission, you will need to run it on the test dataset which we will provide. Submitted models will be evaluated using metrics such as mean absolute error and the r-squared score. For each phenotype, we will compare your model with a baseline linear model and the models of other participants.
